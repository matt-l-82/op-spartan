== Changelog ==

= 1.9.0: March 4th, 2021 =
* New: Added support for the new telemetry functionality in GiveWP 2.10.0
* Fix: Corrected an issue that caused notices to show up on the front-end

= 1.8.0: August 11th, 2020 =
* New: Added a new "Maximum Fee Amount" option so now you can limit the fee coverage calculated amount which helps encourage fee coverage for larger donations amounts.

= 1.7.11: June 22nd, 2020 =
* Fix: In the 1.7.9 there was a conflict with Recurring Donations that caused a PHP Fatal error to occur with certain configurations. This has been resolved so that no errors occur.

= 1.7.10: June 17th, 2020 =
* Fix: The percentage and amount fields in WP-Admin did not appear styled properly since WordPress updated their field styles. This fixes those styles so they appear nicely with the new WP Core field styles.

= 1.7.9: June 16th, 2020 =
* New: Added support for the upcoming release of GiveWP 2.7.0 and the new donation form template.
* New: Added an option for donors to cover the processing fees when updating their recurring donation amount.

= 1.7.8: March 10th, 2020 =

= 1.7.5: May 8th, 2019 =
* Tweak: The integration with Manual Donations has been removed. This is because we feel the purpose of Fee Recovery is to cover transaction fees for donations made through an online Give form. The purpose of Manual Donations is to enter donations that did not originate through an online Give form. Many customers were getting confused with the purpose and integrating with our entire other suite of add-ons had become cumbersome and not up to the quality we strive for.
